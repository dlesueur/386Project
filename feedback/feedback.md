# Peer Feedback For 386 Project

## Research Topic
I considered doing many topics for my project. The top three that I was the most interested in were studying where people take the most outdoor runs, what music I listen to the most often at different times of day or different times of the year, and the correlation between wins and player heights in the NBA.

When I talked to TAs, my classmates, and others the general consensus was that any of the projects would be interesting. I decided to do the NBA one because it was the quickest data for me to access with an API. After talking to my group, I decided to expand my research to also compare in-season and post-season performances for each team and see what variables affect those outcomes.
